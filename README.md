# Python Benchmarks

Collection of scripts/code that benchmark different ways of doing things in Python.

Most code is written to be as self-contained as possible. 
- requiring as few non-standard libraries as possible
- not reusing utility code - so there is currently some repetition within this repository

Simpler benchmarks can be found at the top level directory as .py files.

More complicated benchmarks can be found at the top level directory as directories themselves. As a general convention these benchmarks are run from their own directories using 'main.py'.
